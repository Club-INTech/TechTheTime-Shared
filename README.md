# TechTheTime-Shared

This repository mainly contains hardware description for high-level and low-level software and RPC conventions. The reason for that is to prevent errors due to different shared source version between high-level and low-level source code, by automatically pulling the latest version of this repository each time high-level or low-level source code is built.

Of course, it will not always prevent such error from happening, but it will considerably simplify their resolution.
